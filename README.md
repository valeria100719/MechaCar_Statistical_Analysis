# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

## Delivery 1 (Linear regression)

Using the "dplyr" library, a multiple regression model was run using the lm function with all 6 variables in the database:vehicle length,vehicle weight
spoiler angle,ground clearance and AWD

The variables with very small values of Pr(>|t|) are the vehicle_length and ground_clearance, this means that these monstly contributing to the mpg.

## Delivery 2 (Suspension coil)

The analisys was done considering all the lots togheter and separate.
in the fist study the data suggests that the manufacturing meets the design specifications for PSI, instead if we divided the analysis for lot #, we can see that the PSI value of the lot 3 is higher than the design specifications.

## Delivery 3 (t-test)

the t-test was ran the t-test on 3 different lot#
