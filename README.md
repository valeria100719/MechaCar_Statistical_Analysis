# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis

The goal of this project is to perform a statistical analysis of the MechaCar dataset using multiple linear regression.
In this way we will be able to identify the variables in the dataset that predict the mpg of the MechaCar prototypes.

- The study will be performed using linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the dataset predict the mpg of the MechaCar prototypes.
- Perform t-tests to determine if production batches are statistically different from the mean population.
- Perform a statistical analysis to compare the vehicle performance of MechaCar vehicles with vehicles from other manufacturers.

## Delivery 1 (Linear regression)

Intercept, vehicle_length, and ground_clearance show a significant variation from the mpg values in the dataset.
the slope is not considered zero. Since the null hypothesis H0 is rejected.
The null hypothesis is rejected due to 3 variables (ntercept, vehicle_length and ground_clearance) showing a variance of significance.
such analysis suggests that there may be variables that have not been calculated by our analysis, which should be analyzed.

## Delivery 2 (Suspension coil)

The analisys was done considering all the lots togheter and separate.
in the fist study the data suggests that the manufacturing meets the design specifications for PSI, instead if we divided the analysis for lot #, we can see that the PSI value of the lot 3 is higher than the design specifications.

## Delivery 3 (t-test)

the t-test was ran the t-test on 3 different lot#
